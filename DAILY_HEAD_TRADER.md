## Shadow desk

_no shadow verdicts attached to closed trades yet_

## Coverage — work orders for the Bot Factory


_Every regime observed today has a specialist._

## Probability of passing

**INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** — 0 closed trades. A first-passage estimate needs a stable expectancy and dispersion; computing one from 0 would produce a number with no information in it.

## Patches

See `PATCHES.md` — **0** proposed, none applied.

## Self-critique — would I deploy this desk tomorrow?

- **No.** 0 closed trades, 0/8 bots with any live evidence, and 0 of those trades were structurally invalid rather than informative.
- What I would keep: the risk machinery. Anchors, stop geometry, time exits and the group cap are all now tested, and each was silently broken before.
- What I would not fund: any bot on today's posterior. Every number is prior-dominated.
- What the desk needs: **valid trades, not more code.** The next 20 clean observations decide more than any module I could add.
