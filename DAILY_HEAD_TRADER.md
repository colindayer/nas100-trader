## Shadow desk

| bot::variant | taken | skipped | exp taken | exp skipped | delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BOT_F_nas100_vwap_reversion::v2_trend_align | 1 | 0 | -1.015 | None | None |
| BOT_F_nas100_vwap_reversion::v3_htf_room | 0 | 1 | None | -1.015 | None |
| BOT_F_nas100_vwap_reversion::v4_low_vol | 1 | 0 | -1.015 | None | None |
| BOT_F_nas100_vwap_reversion::v6_wide_stop | 0 | 1 | None | -1.015 | None |

_A shadow needs many observations before a delta means anything. Promotion requires repeated outperformance, not one good week._

## Coverage — work orders for the Bot Factory


_Every regime observed today has a specialist._

## Probability of passing

**INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** — 6 closed trades. A first-passage estimate needs a stable expectancy and dispersion; computing one from 6 would produce a number with no information in it.

_Raw so far: mean -1.388R over 6, total -8.33R. Descriptive only._

## Patches

See `PATCHES.md` — **0** proposed, none applied.

## Self-critique — would I deploy this desk tomorrow?

- **No.** 6 closed trades, 0/8 bots with any live evidence, and 1 of those trades were structurally invalid rather than informative.
- What I would keep: the risk machinery. Anchors, stop geometry, time exits and the group cap are all now tested, and each was silently broken before.
- What I would not fund: any bot on today's posterior. Every number is prior-dominated.
- What the desk needs: **valid trades, not more code.** The next 20 clean observations decide more than any module I could add.
